### Question: OpenBounty promotes bug bounties from other bounty platforms and self-hosted projects. Does OpenBounty have formal partnerships with each of the third-party programs hosted on your bounty board?

In doing so, we want to provide a single source for our hacker community to find trusted bug bounty programs to maximize their impacts and efficiency.
