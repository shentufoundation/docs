## Connect your wallet

After logging in, you need to connect your wallet.

The reason for connecting your wallet is that OpenBounty will encrypt and store each Finding on the blockchain, so it can better protect your rights.

At the same time, after connecting your wallet, you can also use the wallet login function.

⚠️ Note: Since both our finding and Bounty Program will be submitted to the blockchain, you can **no longer** modify your wallet address.
