OpenBounty believes ethical hackers (“Whitehats”) play a crucial role in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors. The contributions of ethical hackers are vital to maintaining the security and integrity of protocols and the broader web3 community. We see this relationship between Whitehats and the web3 community to be an unspoken agreement and it is imperative that ethical hackers adhere to a set of community guidelines to ensure their activities are conducted in a legal, ethical, and professional manner.

These community guidelines have been created to establish a clear framework for ethical hacking practices. By outlining proper behavior, specific rules, and procedures for escalating support issues, we want to foster a culture of respect, responsibility, and continuous improvement within the cybersecurity community. Adherence to these guidelines not only protects the interests of all parties involved but also strengthens the overall security posture of the web3 ecosystem.

## Why are these guidelines important?
These guidelines are important for several reasons:

1. **Protection of Privacy and Data**: They ensure that the privacy and confidentiality of individuals and organizations are respected and protected.
2. **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: They help ethical hackers operate within the bounds of the law and adhere to ethical standards, thus avoiding legal repercussions and maintaining professional integrity.
3. **Minimization of Unnecessary Harm**: They guide ethical hackers to avoid causing unnecessary harm or disruption to systems, networks, and data during their activities.
4. **Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure**: They promote responsible disclosure practices, enabling system owners to address vulnerabilities effectively and in a timely manner.
5. **Professionalism and Respect**: They foster a professional and respectful environment within the cybersecurity community, encouraging collaboration and the sharing of knowledge.
